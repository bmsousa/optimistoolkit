This is the XSD schema used in the Service Manager, partially internally,
partially as messages.

You might have an issue in the ServiceManagerCore, ServiceManagerREST and
ServiceManagerRESTClient projects because the necessary classes are not
considered as included in their build paths even though this project
(ServiceManagerSchema) is on the build path.

If that happens, add "target/generated-sources/xmlbeans" &
"target/generated-classes/xmlbeans" to the build paths of the ServiceManagerCore,
ServiceManagerREST and ServiceManagerRESTClient projects. This lets Eclipse
compile the xmlbeans sources and the errors should vanish.
