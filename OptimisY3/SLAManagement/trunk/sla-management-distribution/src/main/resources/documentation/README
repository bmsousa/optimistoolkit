--------------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------
Java 1.6

Configuration
-------------

One needs to run a configure script before starting and using any of the services.
This script is located in the root directory of the distribution and is called 
configure.py. You can run it as follows:

./configure.py configurations/configure.properties

It uses settings from configure.properties, which you may want to review before running it. 

Starting and Stopping Services
------------------------------

All optimis-sla services can be started using the start.sh script

./start.sh

and can be stopped by the stop.sh script

./stop.sh

The services are

- optimis-sla-server

You can choose which services you want to start/stop through configure.properties

The tail-services.sh script can be used to tail the services log files 

./tail-services.sh

The clean-dist-dir.sh script can be used to clean logs and other files. Please be aware that this
script also removes stored agreements in sla server

./clean-dist-dir.sh .
