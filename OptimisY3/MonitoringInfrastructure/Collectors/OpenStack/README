Instructions on how to install and use the OpenStack's monitoring plugin for
running VMs:
- change the permission of the script to be executable:
chmod 755 vm_collector.sh

- copy the vm_collector.sh file into the physical nodes.
The preferred location is /opt/optimis/MonitoringInfrastructure

- make sure the virt-top package is installed in the physical nodes.
NOTE: the "Domain ID" column should be in position 19. However, it may also
be in the 18th position. Please check the virt-top output!

- modify the virtual_collector.sh script in the IPVM (location: /opt/optimis/MonitoringInfrastructure/scripts)
or in the below SVN location:
optimis/branches/OptimisY3/MonitoringInfrastructure/MI_Scripts/IPVM/MonitoringInfrastructure/scripts
for the following parameters:

# list of nodes
LIST="bscgrid21 bscgrid22"
# location of storing the vm_collector.sh script in the node
DIR=/opt/optimis/MonitoringInfrastructure
# public key to access the node
KEY=root_OPTIMIS

- update virtual_collector.properties in the IPVM (location: /opt/optimis/MonitoringInfrastructure/scripts)
or in the below SVN location:
optimis/branches/OptimisY3/MonitoringInfrastructure/MI_Scripts/IPVM/MonitoringInfrastructure/scripts

and set the below parameter to OpenStack:
CLOUDMIDDLEWARE=OpenStack

- Make sure Aggregator has been deployed in Tomcat. Then, test the plugin by typing:
./virtual_collector.sh
The output would be an XML string.
