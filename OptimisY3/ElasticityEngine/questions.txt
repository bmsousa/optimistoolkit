Open questions:
	- How does data appear? Should we query the MonitoringManager or will data just arrive?
	- How to apply several rules at once? Especially with regard to the above question.
	- What is the type of "value" in the monitoring information?
	
Future considerations:
	- Formulate rules differently for "spot-values" or for sets of measurements?
	- Better to have "rules per ImageID" than "ImageID per rule"
